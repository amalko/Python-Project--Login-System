# Python-Project--Login-System

Description:
Here a login and register system is developed using the following modules in python:
tkinter
pickle
messagebox

for login validation, the program accepts the user credentials from the gui and verifies it against the data pickled as a dictionary in a binary file named "Login_Credentials.pickle" and displays a messagebox with the message 'Login successful' if the credentials match. if they dont match then a messagebox pops up with the message 'Incorrect username or password. Try again.'
the program also has a register option which allows you to add new usee credentials into the dictionary and later pickle them into the file.
